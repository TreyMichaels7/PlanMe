            <h1>Plan Your Life Out (PlanMe)</h1>    
            <h2>Problem Description:</h2>
            <p>
                Communication issues can be one of the biggest difficulties in event planning.
                I know from personal experience that it can be infuriating to spend the time to plan out a detailed event,
                allocate a budget to host the event, and personally invite many people only to have a low turnout.
                Then, when you ask why they didn’t show up or why they didn’t show up on time they tell you something like
                “Oh! That was today?”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But let’s not blame the person invited. After all, they’re probably a busy person with a lot going on in their own lives.
                However, the ability to plan out and communicate/promote events is still a big issue that a lot of event planners face.
                You can do a lot of promoting via making flyers, posters, and sending out emails, 
                but still might not be enough to bring in the turnout you want.
                People still miss the important information, so how can we make it more available to them and also provide a centralized
                location to make it easy to get all the information needed?
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some solutions to this, such as Facebook events. Here, individuals can host and create events
                and personally invite their friends or other members as well based on privacy settings.
                The users invited are notified through the Facebook platform with a link to the page.
                However, while this does make it easier for a planner to easily create an event and invite people,
                it is very limited in that the people invited must be active Facebook users that will check their Facebook notifications.
                Another platform is Eventbrite, but that is mainly used for larger scale events and has a degree of sophistication 
                that is more appropriate for formal, largely established events. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, what if there are people who want to simply plan a night out with friends or other smaller group
                 get-togethers, but also want to plan out medium-to-larger scale events for their communities?
                How can we ensure that the information is communicated effectively to these people so that turnout rates increase? 
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s where “PlanMe” will come in. A web application that provides an easy to access location for all 
                the event information, follows up with the invitees with the information, 
                and will make event planning much simpler while being accessible to a wider range of users.

            <h2>App Description:</h2>
            <p>
                    Users of the web application would be both the event planners as well as the people invited to attend the event.                    
            </p>
            <p>
                For event planners, users would be able to create events with various details such as time, location, description, as well as                     enter emails/phone numbers for people they would be interested in inviting. Event planners would also be required to create an account in order
                to create/edit events. Potential event attendees would not be required to create an account, and if invited, would get an email notification 
                containing all the information they would need to know as soon as the event is created and the invite is sent. Follow up emails would also be
                sent as the event nears to remind the invited user that the event is happening soon. However, a user would also receive a link to the platfrom event page 
                if they were interested in viewing that as well. Invited users and event planners that create an account can also participate in a "groups" feature,
                that would make it easier to invite or join a set group of people, that could be invited for certain events or perhaps even larger scale events. Logged in users
                would also be able to see a set of events they're invited to or events that they're hosting to keep track of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application could be very useful for event planners who might be planning informal events who want to setup a small 
                meeting with friends, or if they want to invite a larger group for a bigger event. In addition to being easy to use, since the platform sends 
                out email/text notifications about events, this platform's usefulness is not only restricted to users who have accounts. The followup reminders                     will also help ensure that the information is being communicated from the planner to the invited person.
